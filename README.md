## Project Implementation

### 1. Flight Data Analysis
   - Analyzed data on **15,666 flights** operated by **13 airlines** from Chicago airport in 2015.
   - Examined information on the number of canceled and delayed flights, as well as the reasons behind these events.

### 2. Data Visualization
   - Created an interactive dashboard in **Tableau**, including the following elements:
     - **Route Map**: Flight routes color-coded by airline.
     - **Pie Charts**: Main reasons for flight cancellations and delays.
     - **Heatmap**: Flight activity over time.
     - **Bar Charts**: Top airports and airlines by number of flights and cancellations.

### 3. Interactivity and Filtering
   - The dashboard allows filtering by:
     - Airlines.
     - Airports.
     - Reasons for cancellations and delays.
   - Implemented interactive features such as actions and tooltips.

### 4. Data Structure
   - Data is presented in three linked tables:
     - **Flights**: Information on flights.
     - **Airlines**: Data on airlines.
     - **Airports**: Information on airports.
   - Relationships between tables are established using airline and airport codes.

### 5. Project Requirements
   - Implemented mandatory components, including:
     - Data model.
     - KPI metrics.
     - Analysis of canceled and delayed flights.
     - Use of parameters, filters, dual axes, and interactivity.
